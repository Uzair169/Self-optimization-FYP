### My Final Year Project (FYP) titled 
# A Distributed Modular Co-simulation Platform for Local Energy Communities with Encapsulated Dynamics 


### How to use it?
Clone the repo and run 
`docker compose up --build` in the main folder




### End-outcome
A modular platform that enables simulation of a modern distribution system
representing energy community that can further developed to test EV integration,
virtual power plant and cyber security concerns.
